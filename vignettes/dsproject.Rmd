Basic package to streamline basic tasks in R



The make_project() function will automatically set up a project. Included folders, Git connection, working directory and ReadMe file can all be customized (see help file).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
make_project(project_name)
```

The use() function will automatically load a package and download it if necessary.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
use(package_name)
```

The import() function will automatically detect a file format and try to import it into the Global Environment as either a data.frame or a tibble. See the help file for a list of supported format.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
df <- import(file)
```
